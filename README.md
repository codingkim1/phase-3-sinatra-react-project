  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Requirements

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models: 
  The update action should be implemented using a form that is 
  pre-filled with existing values for the object. On submission of 
  the form, the object should update. Note: Using a like button or 
  similar will not meet the update requirement.
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Implement proper front end state management. You should be updating state using a
  setState function after receiving your response from a POST, PATCH, or DELETE 
  request. You should NOT be relying on a GET request to update state. 
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary. 
- Routes in your application (both client side and back end) should follow RESTful
  conventions.
- Use your back end optimally. Pass JSON for related associations to the front 
  end from the back end. You should use active record methods in your controller to grab
  the needed data from your database and provide as JSON to the front end. You
  should NOT be relying on filtering front end state or a separate fetch request to
  retrieve related data.



## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

**Important**: Be sure you fork a copy of the repo into your GitHub account
before cloning it. You can do this by using the link above or by clicking the
"Octocat" button at the top of this page, then clicking "Fork" in the upper
right corner of the repo page. 

[fork link]: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-sinatra-react-project/fork


You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).



### Fetch Example

Your React app should make fetch requests to your Sinatra backend! Here's an
example:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9292/test")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
